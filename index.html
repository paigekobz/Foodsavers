        <p>
           Every year approximately one third of all food produced for human consumption in the world (1.3 billion tonnes); gets etiher lost or wasted !
           </p>
      <p>
          Annually, consumers in first world countries waste almost as much food as the whole net production of Sub-Sahara Africa (230 million tonnes)!
         </p>
      <p>
        Even if you did know these facts prior to this website, you have to admit how much food we, as a society, are wasting. Think back to every time you or your family threw something away: how could you have prevented this? Does it ever occur to you how much of the food you buy is never finished? Well, that is what we are here for. 
        </p>
           <p>
        According to our extensive research, the main reason why people waste food occassionaly is because they buy more than they need. Overpurchasing has many causes such as: unorganized shopping behaviour, cheap prices, and the general packaging offered in many grocery stores. For example: many recipes may only need a portion of a vegetable, or just a single food; but most grocery stores don't sell individual foods, instead they sell wholesale packages. Another big reason is the amount of whole sale prices offered in stores: people are more likely to buy an excess of things if they believe it's on sale. 
             </p>
          <p>
      When grocery stores order food for consumers, they overstock a lot. This means that they put out way more food than they expect people to purchase, leading to the waste of tons of perfectly good food.
